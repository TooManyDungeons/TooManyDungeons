This mod is to enhance your Hypixel Skyblock Dungeons experience!
The mod includes a ton of features, such as, but not limited to: A help command, so you can see the commands for the mod (See: Feature #1), Not being able to drop dungeon items (See: Feature #2),  


Features:
    #1.  A help command to see the commands for the mod. This command is /tmdhelp, and will list all of the commands that the mod includes.
    #2. Not being able to drop dungeon items. If you really want to drop the item, you can hold a self-set keybind. The default keybind is LEFT-ALT. So, if you use Q as the regular drop key, you can use 'LEFT-ALT + Q' to drop the item!
